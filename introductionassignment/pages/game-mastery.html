    <h2>Game Mastery</h2>
    <p>
      Hannah Barnes first played Dungeons and Dragons in middle school. After
      taking many years off, she discovered the interest again and began to
      listen to actual play podcasts, using this to hone her knowledge of the
      game. After playing in a mini game called a one shot, Hannah embarked on
      her D&D Dungeon Master journey. She has game mastered several times,
      narrating and guiding gameplay for her table of players. <br />Hannah
      specializes in beginner level one shots, introducing new players to the
      game in a low investment and low commitment environment. She aspires to
      play on an actual play podcast someday, as well as continuing to act as a
      Dungeon Master. Hannah’s greatest role models for game mastering are
      Brennan Lee Mulligan and Matthew Mercer.

      Mulligan is the dungeon master for Dropout TV’s role table top
      role-playing game show Dimension 20, and was Hannah’s first introduction
      back into the world of Dungeons and Dragons. His mastery of guiding the
      players and creating entertaining non-player characters inspires Hannah to
      continue to practice her character creation skills.

      Matthew Mercer is the dungeon master for arguably the most famous Dungeons
      and Dragons actual play show to date: Critical Role. Mercer, as a
      professional voice actor, excels at creating character voices for his
      non-player characters, resulting in an entertaining and immersive
      experience for his table of players. His skill in world building gives
      every other game master a run for their money, creating a world so
      detailed and cohesive that it is available for sale from leading Dungeons
      and Dragons material retailer D&D Beyond.
