    <h2>Academic Achiever</h2>
    <p>
      Hannah Barnes was a consistently successful student.
      Educated through an exclusive private school and in-home education, Hannah
      graduated at the top of her class and was honored as the Class of 2023
      valedictorian. While in school, Hannah achieved gifted level in English,
      and was consistently ahead of her grade level in history, economics, and
      writing. She graduated cum laude, with almost eight years of consistent
      community service, accumulating 724 hours of volunteering time. Hannah
      received an ACT composite score of 31, with an English score of 35, one
      point below the highest possible score. <br>While a student, Hannah sang with
      a college chorus, and participated in the Crystal Lake Raue Center for the
      Arts’ annual Sing Along Handel’s Messiah. She competed in 4-H Hippology
      and Horse Bowl, an equestrian quiz team, and represented McHenry County at
      the state competition for Hippology twice. <br>When Hannah enrolled at McHenry
      County College, she was recruited on two separate occasions for the
      competitive speech team, but turned the offers down in order to continue
      her volunteering. She plans to graduate with the Silver Cord Award for
      Community Service. <br>Hannah continues to volunteer in multiple capacities,
      serving in her church choir and on an event organization team. Outside of
      her volunteering, Hannah works in customer service as well as working as a
      note taker on her college campus. Hannah is the operator of an Etsy shop,
      with her first collection launching this fall. She also intends to use her
      private education to teach a private etiquette class.
