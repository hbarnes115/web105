      <h2>Reading</h2>
      <p>
        Hannah is an avid reader. Reading at high grade levels since elementary
        school, she was once grounded from the library for reading too much. She
        has read an impressive variety of books, from The Odyssey and The Iliad,
        to Shakespeare’s Macbeth, to the entire NIV Bible and the Heidelberg
        Catechism. She has also read works from C.S. Lewis, John Piper, A. W.
        Tozer, and Francis Schaeffer.

        Hannah is curating her personal library, which has already passed 100
        books. Consisting of 115 works of fiction and 34 nonfiction works, her
        collection now officially qualifies as a personal library, according to
        the American Library Association. Her biggest library goal is to reach
        1000 books, which qualifies as a full-fledged library. Her book list now
        includes works such as The Art of War by Sun Tzu, the entire collection
        of Agatha Christie’s Poirot, and Dr. Jordan Peterson’s 12 Rules for
        Life: An Antidote to Chaos.

        Austen’s Pride and Prejudice, Charles Dickens’ Bleak House, Sir Arthur
        Conan Doyle’s Sherlock Holmes, and Dorothy L. Sayers’ Lord Peter Whimsey
        mysteries.
